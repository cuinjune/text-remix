# Text Remix

## Description
This repo is the assignment of the Reading and Writing Electronic Text course at ITP.  

The assignment was to write a program that cuts up and rearranges input texts relied only on information present in the character data itself to generate new texts.

I created a program that rearranges any given text (file or URL) through python script.

## How to use
1. Installation of python3 is required. Follow [this guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) to install it.

cd text-remix
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py /path/to/file.txt
```
